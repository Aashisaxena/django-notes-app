Project Name: Continuous Deployment with Jenkins

---

## Description

This project demonstrates the setup of a continuous deployment pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub for a Python or Node.js application. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Jenkins
- GitHub account
- AWS EC2 instance

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
: https://github.com/Aashisaxena/django-notes-app.git

```

### 2. Configure Jenkins

- Install Jenkins on your local machine or a server.
- Set up Jenkins to use GitHub credentials for authentication.
- Install necessary Jenkins plugins: Docker Pipeline, GitHub Integration, etc.
- Sure, here are the commands to set up Jenkins and Java on a Debian-based system (such as Ubuntu):

### Install Java

```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt update

# Install OpenJDK 11 (or any other preferred version)
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

### Verify Java Installation

```bash
# Check Java version
java -version
```

### Install Jenkins

```bash
# Add Jenkins repository key to your system
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -

# Add Jenkins Debian package repository
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

# Update package index
sudo apt update

# Install Jenkins
sudo apt install jenkins
```

### Start Jenkins Service

```bash
# Start Jenkins service
sudo systemctl start jenkins

# Enable Jenkins service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

### Verify Jenkins Installation

Once Jenkins is installed and running, you can verify its installation by accessing the Jenkins web interface:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` if you installed Jenkins on your local machine. If you installed Jenkins on a remote server, replace `localhost` with the server's IP address or domain name.
2. Follow the instructions to complete the initial setup, including retrieving the initial admin password from the Jenkins server.
3. Complete the installation wizard by selecting the desired plugins and configuring the administrative user.

After completing these steps, you should have Jenkins and Java successfully set up on your system.

### 3. Create Dockerfile

- Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project.
- Configure the Dockerfile to build and run your Python or Node.js application.

### 4. Write Jenkinsfile

- Write a Jenkinsfile in the root directory of your project.
- Define a declarative pipeline in the Jenkinsfile.
- Configure stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.

### 5. Setup Docker Compose

- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define services and network configurations.
- Configure Docker Compose to automatically allocate ports for your application.

### 6. Integrate GitHub Webhooks

- Configure GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins build on repository changes.
- Use SCM pooling in Jenkins to fetch the Jenkinsfile from the GitHub repository.

### 7. Deploy to EC2 Instance

- Configure Jenkins to deploy the application to an EC2 instance using SCM pooling.
- Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions are set for Jenkins to access the EC2 instance.

### 8. Run the Pipeline

- Run the Jenkins pipeline manually or trigger it through GitHub webhook.
- Monitor the pipeline execution in the Jenkins UI.

## Usage

- Make changes to your application code and push them to the GitHub repository.
- Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline, building and deploying the updated application.
